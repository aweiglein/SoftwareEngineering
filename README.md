<br><br>

<h2>Project Requirements</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Design a software system that includes a purpose statement, overview of the problem, goals and objectives for the project and solution, prerequisites, scope, and environment.</li>
  <li>Addresses five distinct requirements from the company's proposal</li>
  <li>Compare Waterfall vs Agile Methodology</li>
  <li>Create two visual representations of your software solution (e.g., storyboard, flowchart, UML diagram, ERD) that illustrate how the system process or workflow aligns with and supports the business process</li>
  <li>Create a test plan with test cases for three different functional aspects of your software solution, including the following:
    <ul class="square">
      <li>Preconditions for each  test case</li>
      <li>Steps for each  test case</li>
      <li>Expected results for each test case</li>
    </ul>
</ul>
<br><br>

<h2>The Challenge</h2>
  <p>You are a member of a software development team for a project, which includes business analysts, solution analysts, developers, quality assurance professionals, and a project manager, among other team members. You have been tasked with completing a solution proposal and design and test plan with the help of your team to support the software development process. The American Video Game Company has provided a high-level requirements document to aid you in identifying an appropriate solution.
<br><br>
The project is to implement a customer relationship management (CRM) system for the sales force of a medium-sized company. The initial requirements document has been provided for you to use in determining a solution. You may choose to implement a customizable/commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) system, or you may decide to have the system custom built. When making this decision, ensure all requirements are considered and can be implemented if choosing a COTS system. If you decide to build the system, consider the additional resources that will be needed. Review the attached “CRM Requirements” document provided with the assessment to gain an overall understanding of the system the American Video Game Company is looking for.</p>
